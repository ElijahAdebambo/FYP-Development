Existing Software comparison


summary 
- a lot of these apps don't have a dashboard page - Project dashboard features allow you to visualize the progress of each project task. As team members track time spent on each task, you’ll see an overview of how much work has been done on each part of the project. This way you know if you’re ahead of schedule (or behind) and can adjust deadlines, time allocations, and resources accordingly


features to add

- customizable dashboards and data views

- Resource Allocation Optimization: Optimize resource allocation by considering team availability, skillsets, and project priorities to avoid overallocation or underutilization.

- can allocate a set amount of time to each developer at the start of sprint/ sdlc, they also have emergency hours as a failsafe if work item needs more time than planned, if they complete all tasks early they can start working on next sprint 

- Improve reporting capabilities with advanced data visualization options, customizable reports, and automated report generation.

-Document Collaboration and Version Control - if enough time

-Agile and Scrum Integration -Seamlessly integrate agile and Scrum methodologies into the software with features like backlog management,
